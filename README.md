# Kaggle_San_Francisco_Crime_Classification

This project represents:
1. Solution for Kaggle competition "San Francisco Crime Classification"
2. Insights for the paper on the ML challenge mentioned above
3. Web API to use predictive model created for the competition

# How to start:

## 1. Download the  repo

- Create a dictionary for the project on your machine
- Open terminal in this dictionary and write: `git clone https://github.com/Nik-Kras/Kaggle_San_Francisco_Crime_Classification.git`

It will download the project and will create a folder for it

## 2. Create Virtual Environment

- Open the project folder with VS Code
- In the VS Code terminal write: `conda create --name kaggle_sfcc python=3.8`

It will create an environment that will run scripts of the project and where all packages (like pandas) will be installed

## 3. Start with `learning`

- Check the folder called `Learning`. There you will find simple tasks aimed on training Python skills
- Make tasks listed in comments, then when all tasks of one script are done - make git commit and push changes
- To do this follow next commands:
`git add .`
`git commit -m "YOUR COMMENT ON THIS TASK"`
`git push`

## 4. Continue with `src`

- This folder contains actual tasks that shall be done to finish the project (However, I start with simple tasks for training purposes)
- Check `utils.py` and make functions as required. They are going to be used for development process

## 5. Go to `notebooks`

- When development stucks and it is difficult to finish some tasks in step #4, go to Jupyter notebooks and try to make a solution there, it could help
