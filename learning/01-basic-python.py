# This excercise will tell you about some python data structures, including the one we will work the most - pandas DataFrame


# 1. Make a loop that will print numbers from 0 to 10

# 2. Make a loop that prints numbers from 0 to 10, but skips number 5

# 3. Make a function that takes a two arguments: max_num and stop_num. Function prints all numbers from 0 to max_num, but stops (function exits) at number 5
# Try to call this function with different parameters

# 4. Make a dictionary that can store max_num and stop_num values. Now improve the function to take a dictionary as an argument

# 5. Convert a dictionary to pandas DataFrame

# 6. Create a list of numbers. Print it and then print it sorted

# 7. Now, make a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary should have two keys: "name" and "age".

# 8. Convert a list of dictionaries to pandas DataFrame, visualise it as you like

# 9. Make a function that takes pandas DataFrame and column name as arguments. It will return all values stored in the DatFrame column with this column name
# Basically, just visualises the column
